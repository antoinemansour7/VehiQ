### Meeting Summary

- **Trying to get everyone's environment set up and working properly:**
  - We had difficulty to install Django on the frontend's team computer.
  - We had to install a few packages and dependencies to get Django to work.
  - We spent a lot of time with the configurations and our environment.
  - We were able to get everyone's environment set up and working but as soon as a branch was switched, the environment was not working anymore.
  - We also had problems that we were not able to run the djamgo servr and the vue server at the same time.
  - This set us back in time so we could not advance on the tasks we had planned for today.

## Next Steps:
- try to fix the environment and get it working properly.

<br> The meeting was adjourned at 7:00 PM.
