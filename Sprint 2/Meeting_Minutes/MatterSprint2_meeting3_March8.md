<br>There were 2 meetings this day. The first meeting was started at 11:00 AM and lasted until 5:00 PM. It was a meeting for the frontend (Cristina, Julia and Jackson). The second meeting started at 5:00 PM and lasted until 6:30 PM and it was a meeting for everyone. 

### Meeting Agenda

1. Advance together on the frontend and help with errors and bugs.
2. Try to merge the frontend with the backend.

### Meeting Summary

- **Discussing the progress of the frontend:**
  - The frontend team was met with some errors and bugs.
  - We had a hard time with the configurations and our environment
  - This set us back a bit and we were not able to present a working frontend to the backend team

- **Trying to connect the frontend to the backend:**
  - We tried to connect the frontend to the backend.
  - We were not able to connect the frontend to the backend because the frontend was not working properly.
  - We decided to have another meeting to try to connect the frontend to the backend.
  - Because we did not have these two functioning together, we could not present the final product at the demo.


## Next Steps:
- Have another meeting to try to connect the frontend to the backend.

<br> The meeting was adjourned at 7:00 PM.
